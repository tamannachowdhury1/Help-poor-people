                Floods can also occur in rivers when the flow rate exceeds the capacity of the river channel,
                particularly at bends or meanders in the waterway. Floods often cause damage to homes and businesses

            <p>Flooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies, such as a river, lake, or ocean, in
                which
                the water overtops or breaks levees, resulting in some of that water escaping its usual
                boundaries,or it
                may occur due to an accumulation of rain.</p>
